Introduction
Dimensionality reduction is an essential step in data analysis and machine learning, particularly when handling high-dimensional datasets. By reducing the number of input variables while preserving the critical structure and patterns in the data, dimensionality reduction enhances computational efficiency, reduces storage needs, and facilitates data visualization.

This project delves into Advanced Dimensionality Reduction (ADR) techniques, applying them to diverse datasets (image, tabular, and medical) using Python in Google Colab and Databricks. The accompanying notebooks and walkthroughs aim to showcase the utility, effectiveness, and trade-offs of each method in real-world scenarios.

   Overview of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
1. Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)</br>
Focuses on capturing non-linear structures in high-dimensional data.
Preserves local neighborhood relationships when projecting data into a reduced space.
2. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</br>
A non-linear technique designed for effective data visualization.
Highlights clusters by preserving local relationships in the data.
3. ISOMAP</br>
Extends Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) by incorporating global geometric structures.
Ensures a faithful lower-dimensional representation of the original dataset.
4. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)</br>
Known for its computational efficiency and interactive visualization capabilities.
Strives to maintain both local and global data relationships.
5. Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)</br>
Preserves pairwise distance relationships in the data during dimensionality reduction.
6. Randomized Principal Component Analysis (Randomized PCA)</br>
Accelerates PCA computations using randomization techniques.
Well-suited for large datasets requiring efficient processing.
7. Kernel PCA</br>
An extension of traditional PCA that leverages kernel methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction.
8. Incremental PCA</br>
A variation of PCA designed for large datasets.
Processes data in batches to minimize memory usage.
9. Factor Analysis</br>
A statistical method that uncovers latent variables (factors) to explain data structures.
10. Autoencoders
Neural network-based methods for learning compressed, non-linear representations of data.
